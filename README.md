# 🦠 Covid-19 Data Analysis Project using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Covid-19 Data Analysis Project** involves collecting and analyzing real-time data on Covid-19 cases, recoveries, fatalities, and vaccinations from a reliable dataset.  

This project uses **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** to:
- Clean and manipulate Covid-19 data  
- Visualize trends in **cases, deaths, and vaccinations**  
- Identify **patterns and correlations** (e.g., impact of vaccinations on deaths)  
- Compare statistics across countries
